1. In estimator, should we call finish() function after each round or we should call it just when
    we want to get the estimation and compute the error? The point is that each frequency is 
    depending on previous ones and if we call finish() we are clipping the frequencies.
    NOTE: Currently I never clip the frequency and I just clip a copy of it.

2. How to treat the replicated value?
    - I prefer to have Central DP algorithm after result of estimator to implement concept of estimator.
    - Currently I support it at data level in following way:
        * I set the height of replicated value as previous ones.
        * I use the replicated values just for instantaneous estimation and when going to next
            round I ignore them. (Even in this method, we get increase in number of people in certain
            levels of privacy, Is it correct or not?)
